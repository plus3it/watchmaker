**Released**: 2017.07.25

**Summary**:

    *   Updates the EL7 stig baseline to manage the FIPS state. The state
        defaults to `enabled` but can be overridden via a pillar or grain,
        `ash-linux:lookup:fips-state`. The grain takes precedence over the
        pillar. Valid values are `enabled` or `disabled`

        Set-DnsSearchSuffix.ps1 helper would fail because the builtin
        PowerShell version does not work when `$null` is used in a ValidateSet.
        The equivalent value must now be passed as the string, `"null"`
*   scap-formula
    *   Adds SCAP content for the Window Server 2016 SCAP v1r1 Benchmark

**Released**: 2017.07.08

**Summary**:

*   [[Issue #341][341]][[PR #342][342]] Manages selinux around salt state
    execution. In some non-interactive execution scenarios, if selinux is
    enforcing it can interfere with the execution of privileged commands (that
    otherwise work fine when executed interactively). Watchmaker now detects if
    selinux is enforcing and temporarily sets it to permissive for the duration
    of the salt state execution

*   [[Issue #316][316]][[PR #320][320]] Improves logging when salt state
    execution fails due to failed a state. The salt output is now returned to
    the salt worker, which processes the output, identifies the failed state,
    and raises an exception with the state failure

        salt that does not handle quoted values in /etc/sysconfig/network.

## 0.4.2

**Commit Delta**: [Change from 0.4.1 release](https://github.com/plus3it/watchmaker/compare/0.4.1...0.4.2)

**Released**: 2017.05.19

**Summary**:

*   [[PR #301][301]] Sets the grains for admin_groups and admin_users so the
    keys are named as expected by the join-domain formula
*   ash-linux-formula
    *   Adds a custom module that lists users from the shadow file
    *   Gets local users from the shadow file rather than `user.list_users`.
        Prevents a domain-joined system from attempting to iterate over all
        domain users (and potentially deadlocking on especially large domains)
*   join-domain-formula
    *   Modifies PBIS install method to use RPMs directly, rather than the
        SHAR installer
    *   Updates approaches to checking for collisions and current join status
        to better handle various scenarios: not joined, no collision; not
        joined, collision; joined, computer object present; joined, computer
        object missing
    *   Disables NSS enumeration to prevent PBIS from querying user info from
        the domain for every call to getent (or equivalents); domain-based
        user authentication still works fine
*   name-computer-formula
    *   (Linux) Does not attempt to retain network settings, to avoid a bug in
        salt; will be revisited when a patched salt version has been released

## 0.4.1

**Commit Delta**: [Change from 0.4.0 release](https://github.com/plus3it/watchmaker/compare/0.4.0...0.4.1)

**Released**: 2017.05.09

**Summary**:

*   (EL7) Running _watchmaker_ against EL7 systems will now pin the resulting
    configuration to the watchmaker version. See the updates to the two
    formulas in this version. Previously, _ash-linux_ always used the content
    from the `scap-security-guide` rpm, which was updated out-of-sync with
    _watchmaker_, and so the resulting configuration could not be pinned by
    pinning the _watchmaker_ version. With this version, _ash-linux_ uses
    content distributed by _watchmaker_, via _scap-formula_, and so the
    resulting configuration will always be same on EL7 for a given version of
    _watchmaker_ (as has always been the case for the other supported
    operating systems).
*   ash-linux-formula
    *   Supports getting scap content locations from pillar
*   scap-formula
    *   Updates stig content with latest benchmark versions
    *   Adds openscap ds.xml content, used to support remediate actions

## 0.4.0

**Commit Delta**: [Change from 0.3.1 release](https://github.com/plus3it/watchmaker/compare/0.3.1...0.4.0)

**Released**: 2017.05.06

**Summary**:

*   [[PR #286 ][286]] Sets the computername grain with the correct key expected
    by the formula
*   [[PR #284 ][284]] Converts cli argument parsing from `argparse` to `click`.
    This modifies the `watchmaker` depedencies, which warranted a 0.x.0 version
    bump. Cli and API arguments remain the same, so the change should be
    backwards-compatible.
*   name-computer-formula
    *   Adds support for getting the computername from pillar
    *   Adds support for validating the specified computername against a
        pattern
*   pshelp-formula
    *   Attempts to address occasional stack overflow exception when updating
        powershell help

## 0.3.1

**Commit Delta**: [Change from 0.3.0 release](https://github.com/plus3it/watchmaker/compare/0.3.0...0.3.1)

**Released**: 2017.05.01

**Summary**:

*   [[PR #280][280]] Modifies the dynamic import of boto3 to use only absolute
    imports, as the previous approach (attempt absolute and relative import)
    was deprecated in Python 3.3
*   ntp-client-windows-formula:
    *   Stops using deprecated arguments on reg.present states, which cleans up
        extraneous log messages in watchmaker runs under some configurations
*   join-domain-formula:
    *   (Windows) Sets the DNS search suffix when joining the domain, including
        a new pillar config option, `ec2config` to enable/disable the EC2Config
        option that also modifies the DNS suffix list.

## 0.3.0

**Commit Delta**: [Change from 0.2.4 release](https://github.com/plus3it/watchmaker/compare/0.2.4...0.3.0)

**Released**: 2017.04.24

**Summary**:

*   [[Issue #270][270]] Defaults to a platform-specific log directory when
    call from the CLI:
    *   Windows: `${Env:SystemDrive}\Watchmaker\Logs`
    *   Linux: `/var/log/watchmaker`
*   [[PR #271][271]] Modifies CLI arguments to use explicit log-levels rather
    than a verbosity count. Arguments have been adjusted to better accommodate
    the semantics of this approach:
    *   Uses `-l|--log-level` instead of `-v|--verbose`
    *   `-v` and `-V` are now both used for `--version`
    *   `-d` is now used for `--log-dir`

    service, before and after the install

*   [[Issue #238][238]] Captures all unhandled exceptions and logs them
*   [[Issue #234][234]] Stops the salt service prior to managing salt formulas,

    being locked
*   [[Issue #72][72]] Manages salt service so the service state after
    watchmaker completes is the same as it was prior to running watchmaker. If
    the service was running beforehand, it remains running afterwards. If the
    service was stopped (or non-existent) beforehad, the service remains
    stopped afterwards
*   [[Issue #163][163]] Modifies the `user_formulas` config option to support
    a map of `<formula_name>:<formula_url>`
*   [[PR #235][235]] Extracts salt content to the same target `srv` location
    for both Window and Linux. Previously, the salt content was extracted to
    different points in the filesystem hierarchy, which required different
    content for Windows and Linux. Now the same salt content archive can be
    used for both
*   [[PR #242][242]] Renames salt worker param `content_source` to
    `salt_content`

        Windows systems
