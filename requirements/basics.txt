## Minimal tools related to building this project
# CI uses the 'uv' CLI as the front-end build tool (installed via pip here).
# The PEP 517 backend is defined in pyproject.toml [build-system] and will be
# resolved automatically by the frontend. We also pin it here for reproducibility
# in environments that choose to invoke the backend directly.
