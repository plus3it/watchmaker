# Watchmaker

Applied Configuration Management

## Overview

Watchmaker is a Python package that helps bootstrap a vanilla OS image and
apply an OS configuration. Watchmaker itself reads a simple YAML configuration
file, which can be hosted on the local filesystem or on a web server.

Complex configuration management (CM) environments may be layered in as part of
the provisioning framework. Watchmaker includes a default configuration that
will install Salt and a handful Salt Formulas that can be used to harden a
system to DISA STIG standards, as well as integrate with common enterprise
services.
